Ask yourself, Why are you doing that? Or, why did you do that? Question everything. Have a reason to explain every decision you make. Having reasons is important because a clear, definite reason is self-evident truth. It is right. It is good. It is perfect. Having reasons is important because it makes you think and be consistent, and because when you don’t have a reason you usually don’t think. Your reason is important because you are always aware of it, you will have the opportunity to question it to ensure it is true. If you have a reason to do something, then do it. If you don’t have a reason to do something, then don’t do it. Reason from first principles. Ask why, why, why\n",
